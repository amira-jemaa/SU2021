## NOTES from books : 
## TRAP COMMAND : 
 + To obtain services from the operating system, a user program must make a system call, which traps into the kernel and invokes the operating system. The TRAP
instruction switches from user mode to kernel mode and starts the operating system. When the work has been completed, control is returned to the user program at
the instruction following the system call.
